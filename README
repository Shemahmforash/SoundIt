This is a program built in the Java programming language that is divided in two parts.

The first part is an Audio Framework available in the folder /src/com/icdif/audio that is able to read and play mp3/wave files and can process the raw data from this files into a human readable form. Using this human readable format, it can also apply some mathematical analysis in order to detect the beats (onsets).
Besides this, the framework can also plot the audio data as well as the processed data.

The second part of the program is a visual interface built with Swing that gives the user the possibility to interact with the framework by importing files and plotting the results obtained by the processing methods referred earlier.

Note: The processing methods were based in the articles Belo et al - "A Tutorial on Onset Detection in Music Signals" (available at http://icdif.com/soundit/Bello-TSAP-2005.pdf) and Simon Dixon - "Onsed Detection Revised" (available at http://icdif.com/soundit/p_133.pdf).
